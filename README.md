# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Additionally I added react-tsparticles(A background theme for my project),
Installation:npm install react-tsparticles

Then I included React-router(to navigate in my own page),
Installation:npm i react-router

By using the above mentioned packages and the default packages of react.js I have done my first React App(Portfolio Website).
